I feel really tired to rest at home today. Why are you so tired to take this road? I don't know if you can find a satisfactory job when you come out to find a job after learning. The road of the Internet is really difficult. You have to learn so much every day. It depends on how many codes they have to play at work. Do you really like this thing?
